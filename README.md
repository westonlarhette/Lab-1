# Lab-1
This repository contains files included from our Python lab #1 which overlaps between Session 2 and Session 3. We were instructed to play around with Jupyter notebook and try to add text, images, and mathematical equations to a sample Jupyter notebook. I also have included the code I wrote in Python for some simple physics problems that we wrote in class.
